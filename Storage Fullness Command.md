# Storage Fullness Command
Use this when you want to check if the storage is full. For this course, generally we check storage when the device is not turning on completely or has a boot failure. The nature of the startup in these cases is that the devices freezes or a cursor blinks at the top left corner.

Use this command below to view storage percentage of the current storage device on the Jetson Orin Nano in use

```df -h```
